In his or her lifetime, an adult perceives and is in contact with an average of approximately 9,000 faces, often viewing them in multiple crowds simultaneously. Despite this complexity, however, the human visual system is remarkably sensitive, such that it is able to identify specific faces in a crowd within only a matter of milliseconds.1 While single face perception has been widely studied, ensemble perception, or the perception of crowds as a whole, is a newly emerging field. To date, ensemble perception has been studied using a limited display of single crowds, hence failing to simulate the visual intricacy of real-life interactions. This experiment increases ecological validity by examining whether participants perceive statistical differences when multiple crowds are presented simultaneously in the visual field. Our initial findings suggest that participants are indeed sensitive to statistical variances in multiple crowds. Overall, this investigation provides preliminary evidence that ensemble perception operates efficiently across multiple groups in a scene, potentially providing a plethora of practical applications, ranging from illness detection in the healthcare industry to threat detection in public areas.
